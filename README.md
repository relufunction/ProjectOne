# Neural Network From Scratch

The project is to build a neural network from scratch. The motivation for this project is from nnfs.io a website build by [@Sentdex](https://github.com/Sentdex). Nnfs.io is actually meant for a book that teaches the fundamentals of neural network and help us to build our own network. Let's build a new neural network where we can learn the fundamentals and make a great hands-on work space for aspiring machine learning engineers and the GitHub community.

Even though the code is build in plain python, code is not commented. For more understanding you can visit [nnfs.io](https://www.nnfs.io) or [sendtex youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/sentdex).

## Starting the project

start the environment first:

>Windows : scratch-neural-network/venv/Scripts/activate.bat
Linux/Mac : source -m venv scratch-neural-network/venv/Scripts/activate

## Calling for Contributions !!

Please feel free to join the repository, the code is in it's budding stage and I would like to build this project into a fully fledged deep learning framework. I have opened the discussions and project kanban board for the repository.

> Any sort of contribution to this repository is appreciated. Visit [Discussion](https://github.com/jayasooryantm/scratch-neural-network/discussions) or [Project Board](https://github.com/users/jayasooryantm/projects/3) to find the issues and upcoming tasks.

**More Details & Documentations are on the way**
